/**
 * @class KQuickAddons::ManagedConfigModule managedconfigmodule.h KQuickAddons/ManagedConfigModule
 *
 * The base class for configuration modules using KConfigXT settings.
 *
 * Configuration modules are realized as plugins that are loaded only when
 * needed.
 *
 * The module in principle is a simple widget displaying the
 * item to be changed. The module has a very small interface.
 *
 * All the necessary glue logic and the GUI bells and whistles
 * are provided by the control center and must not concern
 * the module author.
 *
 * To write a config module, you have to create a C++ library
 * and an accompaning QML user interface.
 * The library must contain a factory function like the following:
 *
 * \code
 * #include <KPluginFactory>
 *
 * K_PLUGIN_FACTORY(MyConfigModuleFactory, registerPlugin<MyConfigModule>() )
 * \endcode
 *
 * The constructor of the ConfigModule then looks like this:
 * \code
 * YourConfigModule::YourConfigModule( QObject* parent )
 *   : ManagedConfigModule( parent ),
 *     SettingsObject( this )
 * {
 *   KAboutData *about = new KAboutData(
 *     <kcm name>, i18n( "..." ),
 *     KDE_VERSION_STRING, QString(), KAboutLicense::GPL,
 *     i18n( "Copyright 2006 ..." ) );
 *   about->addAuthor( i18n(...) );
 *   setAboutData( about );
 *   .
 *   .
 *   .
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * We are assuming here that SettingsObject is a class generated from a kcfg file
 * and that it will be somehow exposed as a constant property to be used from the QML side.
 * It will be automatically discovered by ManagedConfigModule which will update
 * the saveNeeded and defaults inherited properties by itself. Thus by inheriting from
 * this class you shall not try to manage those properties yourselves.
 *
 * The QML part must be in the KPackage format, installed under share/kpackage/kcms.
 * @see KPackage::Package
 * The package must have the same name as the KAboutData componentName, to be installed
 * by CMake with the command:
 * kpackage_install_package(package kcm_componentName kcms)
 * given "package" is the subdirectory in the source tree where the package sources are
 * located, and "kcm_componentName" is the componentname passed to the KAboutData in the
 * C++ part.
 * The main config dialog UI will be the file
 * ui/main.qml from the package (or what X-KPackage-MainScript value is in the
 * package metadata desktop file).
 *
 * The QML part can access all the properties of ManagedConfigModule (together with the properties
 * defined in its subclass) by accessing to the global object "kcm", or with the
 * import of "org.kde.kcm 1.0" the ConfigModule attached property.
 *
 * \code
 * import QtQuick 2.1
 * import QtQuick.Controls 1.0 as QtControls
 * import org.kde.kcm 1.0
 * import org.kde.plasma.core 2.0 as PlasmaCore
 *
 * Item {
 *     //implicitWidth and implicitHeight will be used as initial size
 *     //when loaded in kcmshell5
 *     implicitWidth: units.gridUnit * 20
 *     implicitHeight: units.gridUnit * 20
 *
 *     ConfigModule.buttons: ConfigModule.Help|ConfigModule.Apply
 *     Label {
 *         text: kcm.needsSave
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * See https://techbase.kde.org/Development/Tutorials/KCM_HowTo
 * for more detailed documentation.
