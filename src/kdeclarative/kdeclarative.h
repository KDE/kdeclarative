/**
 * @class KDeclarative::KDeclarative kdeclarative.h <KDeclarative/KDeclarative>
 *
 * The KDeclarative class is used to manipulate the QQmlEngine instance used by
 * the application and to get some information about the platform,
 * that influences the behavior of the QML components.
 *
 * In order to use it, you will need a pointer to a QQmlEngine, and call
 * `setupEngine(engine)` at least once on the engine.
 * @code
 *     KDeclarative::KDeclarative::setupEngine(engine);  // if not done elsewhere
 * @endcode
 *
 * To setup integration with KI18n's translation methods and thus being able to call
 * i18n() from anywhere in your QML code., you set a KLocalizedContext from Ki18n
 * directly like this (since KF 5.17):
 * @code
 *     KLocalizedContext *localizedContextObject = new KLocalizedContext(engine);
 *     // if not using the global application domain, set custom domain name
 *     localizedContextObject->setTranslationDomain(QStringLiteral("mydomainname"));
 *     engine->rootContext()->setContextObject(localizedContextObject);
 * @endcode
 *
 * In case your code should work with KF versions before 5.17, use these deprecated
 * calls instead:
 * @code
 *     KDeclarative::KDeclarative decl;
 *     decl.setDeclarativeEngine(engine);
 *     // if not using the global application domain, set custom domain name
 *     decl.setTranslationDomain(QStringLiteral("mydomainname"));
 *     decl.setupContext();
 * @endcode
 *
